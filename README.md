## 📖 About
This project provides a customizable Discord Rich Presence (RP) with a modern, dark-themed UI built using **CustomTkinter**. It features a preset management system, allowing you to switch between different statuses easily.

* **Concept & Logic Design:** Renji
* **Implementation:** Assisted by AI (Antigravity/Gemini) focusing on modern UI/UX and OOP practices.

## 💻 Compatibility / Supported Platforms
* ✅ **Windows:** Fully supported (Download .exe in Releases)
* 🚧 **Linux:** Planned (Currently works via Source Code)
* ❌ **macOS:** Not planned yet (Requires specific hardware/license)

---

## ⚠️ Safety Note regarding Antivirus / VirusTotal
If you download the `.exe` version, your antivirus (or VirusTotal) might flag it as a threat (Generic/Trojan).
**This is a False Positive.**

* **Why does this happen?** This app is built with Python and compiled using `PyInstaller`. Many antivirus engines automatically flag uncertified Python executables that interact with system processes (like checking CPU/RAM) as suspicious.
* **Transparency:** This project is Open Source. If you are uncomfortable running the `.exe`, you are encouraged to **review the source code (`main.py`)** and run it directly using Python.

## ⚙️ How to Setup (Getting Client ID)

2.  Log in with your Discord account.
3.  Click the **"New Application"** button (top right).
4.  Give it a name (e.g., *"Playing with Foxes"* or whatever you want to show on your profile).
5.  Agree to the terms and click **Create**.
6.  Go to **OAuth2** tab on left panel.
7.  Copy the **"Client ID"** shown on the screen.
